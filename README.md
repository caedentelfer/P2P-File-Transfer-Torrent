# P2P File Sharing

## Description

- The project implements a simplified version of a P2P file sharing program.
- The program allows clients to connect directly to each other for file sharing.

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Compile and Run using Makefile:**

   - `make run-server`: Compiles and runs the server.
   - `make run-client`: Compiles and runs the client.
   - `make clean`: Removes the `bin` folder and class files.

2. **Manual Compilation and Execution:**
   - `javac P2PServer.java`: Compile the server.
   - `java P2PServer`: Run the server.
   - `javac P2PClient.java`: Compile the client.
   - `java P2PClient`: Run the client.

## Usage

- Run the server before starting any client programs.
- Connect the clients to the server to enable file sharing between them.
